### What is MOBAWatch?

  MOBA is an attempt to make a 1 lane ARAM (All Random, All Mid) version of a MOBA within Overwatch's "Workshop" system.
This project accomplishes this by:
 1. Transferring player look angle to 2D movement
 2. Creating a "dummy" bot for each player to enact their actions in their stead
 3. Simulating minions using in-world text, effects and a large array with which to store their information
 4. Simulating structures using a similar system
 5. Altering player abilities to best fit the new perspective
 6. Disabling or limiting specific heroes which would be too costly to manage
